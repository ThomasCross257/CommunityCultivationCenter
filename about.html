	<h1>Who are we?</h1>
	</div>
	<div class="w3-container w3-teal">
 <div class="demo-type-example">
	 <p>The team behind the Community Cultivation Center has a long history of service within the community. Our CEO, Daniel Purcell, has been involved with many nonprofits in his life thus far, and hopes to continue to engage throughout his life. He began in 2014, working with a regional branch of the National nonprofit Camp Fire. There, he underwent rigorous team building and community service training at a local summer camp, and wound up with over 200 hours of community service hours. Daniel continued to work with Camp Fire until 2016, when another nonprofit, Outdoor Journeys, was born out of Camp Fire. Outdoor Journeys runs the aforementioned summer camp, and focuses on connecting children with the outdoors. One of their biggest missions is to send children of a lower socioeconomic background to camp for free. They work with the Upland Housing Authority (public housing), and provide the children who live there with “scholarships” to camp. The weeks these children spend at camp often have a far greater impact than initially anticipated. It helps the children forget the social barriers that exist in society, and allows them to focus on something positive.
	 </p>
	 <p>In addition to this, Daniel is a very environmentally conscious individual who is committed to sustainability. He plans to major in Environmental Studies while in college. He has a keen knowledge of biology and geology, and some background experience in gardening.
Inspired by these two things, Daniel came up with the rough idea for Community Cultivation Center and presented it to the rest of the team. The idea has been morphing ever since. Initially, we wanted to help out the homeless, but eventually shifted to helping domestic abuse victims for a few reasons. Domestic violence victims have an incentive to leave and move on, whereas the homeless may have a tendency to take advantage of similar resources.

	<h1>Our Mission</h1>
	</div>
		<div class="demo-type-example">
		<p2>Domestic violence is one of the most common problems in America today. An average of 10 million people will be abused by their partner every single year. That is 20 people per minute, or one every nine seconds. It is not a regional problem, it is an epidemic that has reached all parts of the globe. Women who have been abused have been shown to be at a higher risk of contracting STDs, having an unintended pregnancy, and being diagnosed with mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder.
</p2>
		<p3>Many abusers have a past history of abuse; children of abusive parents are more likely to be abusers themselves. Domestic violence often arises when one partner feels the need to control or dominate the other. This can arise from a myriad of factors, ranging from jealousy, anger management issues, or due to a sense of socioeconomic or educational inferiority. Most often, though, is that many men have the misogynistic view that women are inferior to men, and they use this to justify their actions. What is perhaps the scariest aspect of most abusive relationships is the imbalance of power. There is of course an imbalance of physical power, but what is far worse is the imbalance of financial power.
</p3>
		<p></p>
		<p4>There are many factors that keep victims in abusive relationships, but one of the most inconspicuous reasons is the aforementioned imbalance of financial power. Statistically, in the United States women make 20% less than men. Since victims of domestic abuse are most often female, this means that women victims are automatically at a financial disadvantage. Many women stay in these abusive relationships simply due to the fact that they don’t have access to the resources they would need to live on their own. Furthermore, a common threat from the abuser is to ruin the victim financially, which traps them in.
</p4>
		<p></p>
		<p5>There are domestic violence centers around the US that provide temporary relief housing, group therapy, and informational classes to women who have been abused. Often they are referred to as “women’s shelters.” These shelters can be found across the US, and are often one of the principal places to go for relief. Many cities offer domestic violence informational seminars, which inform the general public about the specifics of the problem.
</p5>
		<p></p>
		<p6>Many of the domestic violence centers are underfunded, which reduces their efficacy. Another problem with these facilities is that they often only provide temporary relief, which of course stems from the lack of resources. As our team found in our research, there are simply not enough centers to meet the demand. Additionally, as mentioned earlier, many of these centers provide only temporary relief to a permanent problem. What victims need is long term assistance; they need to be checked up on periodically.
</p6>
		<p></p>
		<p7>The Community Cultivation Center will fill in the cracks that are currently present in the domestic abuse relief system. We will ideally have an investment that provides us with ample financial resources to help victims. Furthermore, our organization will not be tied directly to any domestic violence centers, which gives us some discretionary authority, as well as removing us from their lack of financial resources. We are going to provide these women with long-term relief programs that address both the topical symptoms of the problem, as well as attacking the root cause. CCC will provide follow ups as well; we will talk to the victims about how well they think our program is working, what works best for them, and how we as an organization can improve.
